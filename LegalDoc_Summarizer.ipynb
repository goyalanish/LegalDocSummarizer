Some of the functions of the Software may be limited based on the version. Updating to the latest version may improve your user experience.\\n\\n7.3 Your Huawei device will automatically search for and download new update packages to provide you with timely update services. These updates are designed to resolve cyber security loopholes and prevent new threats, and it is important to accept and install security related system updates in a timely manner.

We strongly recommend that you do not change your device\\'s default settings to avoid software issues resulting from delayed updates. To disable this features, go to About phone (or About tablet) in Settings, touch Build number several times and follow the prompts to activate Developer mode, then go to Developer options in Settings and disable Automatic system updates.\\nSome apps may have automatic update functions, and may download and install new versions to your device automatically.

Where Samsung Mobile Device is being used by your employee or other person using the Samsung Mobile Device as part of your undertaking (\"Your Staff\"), that member of your Staff is licenced to use the Samsung Software as if it were you and must comply with these terms on the same basis. Any failure to comply with these terms by your Staff shall be deemed to a failure to comply with these terms by you.\\n\\nSAMSUNG SOFTWARE UPDATES.\\n\\nSamsung may make available to you updates, upgrades, supplements and add-on components (if any) of the Samsung Software, including bug fixes, service upgrades (parts or whole), and updates, enhancements and feature improvements or deletion to any Samsung Software (including entirely new versions), (collectively \"Update\") after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Samsung Software. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update, unless we provide other terms along with such Update. To use Samsung Software provided through Update, you must first be licensed for the Samsung Software identified by Samsung as eligible for the Update.\\n\\nWhile the Update will be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the Samsung Software updates will only be offered by your network carrier, and such Samsung Software updates will be governed by your contractual relationship with your network carrier.\\n\\nWith the \"Software download automatically\" function enabled (as in the default setting in the \"About Device\" menu in the Setting), your device downloads certain Updates automatically from time to time through Wi-Fi connection. If you have chosen to disable the \"Software download automatically \"function, then you can check the availability of new Updates and download them by clicking on the \"Software download manually\" menu in the Setting. Given the importance of receiving Updates for security software in a timely manner to defend against new threats, however, security-related Updates may be automatically downloaded and installed without your consent, even if you have disabled the \"Software download automatically\" function. This protects your Samsung Mobile Device directly and every Samsung Mobile Device in use via the concept of \"herd\" or \"community immunity\". We recommend that you check availability of any new Updates periodically for optimal use of your device.\\n\\nCONSENT TO USE OF DATA.\\n\\nBy using this device or any Samsung Mobile Device, you agree to the use of your information in the manner described below and in accordance with the Samsung Privacy Policy: available at http://account.samsung.com/membership/pp\\n\\n(a)   Software Updates.

The unique identifiers may include hardware identifiers, subscription information and telephone number for your Samsung Mobile Device and will be collected by us to set up these additional features for you to use.

Unless your device is connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi connection, the Samsung Software will access the internet through your mobile network, which may result in additional charges depending on your payment plan.
